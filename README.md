# F28WP-lab1 - Website Improvement Journey
Welcome to the README for the website! This is for highlighting the changes made in both Week 1 and Week 2.

# Week 1: Enhancing Visual Appeal with CSS
In Week 1, I improved the visual appeal of my website. I used CSS to change the design and make it more aesthetically pleasing design.

# Week 2: Website more interactive 
In Week 2, I changed the looks again and enhanced the looks by changing different things like making a sticky header.
